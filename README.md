# LawnMower

LownMower - group project of 2 members
          - created using object-oriented programming concepts. 

This lawn mower is controlled using a mobile application. 
You can choose the movement direction by pressing some arrow buttons: go forward, go backward, turn left, turn right. 
You can choose the height of the airscrew by choosing one of the five levels created. A rack and pinion mechanism makes the motor go higher or lower in order to create the height-choosing option.

My role was to write the code for the lawnmower and to set the drivers for motors and the ultrasonic sensor.

The other member created  the mobile application, the chassis and the rack and pinion mechanism.
